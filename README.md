# Village Hero+
This pack aims to make villagers better show their appreciation when you defeat a raid by replacing the villager gift loot tables. Forget receiving a single blank map from a cartographer; with this pack, you might get a few lodestones, a map to an ancient city or even a recovery compass! Each profession has a roughly 0.5% chance of dropping a rare item, such as a block of ancient debris, elytra, netherite tool, enchanted golden apple or even a luck potion--which you can use for a chance at more gifts!

A few notes: 

- If you're using Minecraft 1.21.1 or earlier, bundles must be enabled, as they are part of the leatherworker's loot table.
- The rare gifts from the butcher and leatherworker are luck potions, and the fletcher has a chance of giving arrows of luck. With this data pack, luck increases the chance of bonus rolls for additional gifts while a player has the Hero of the Village status.
- Nitwits will still give you seeds and pre-1.21.2, baby villagers will still give you poppies.
- The versions for 1.21.2+ include location-based loot tables for unemployed and baby villagers.
  - Limited support for location-based gifts from villagers in non-vanilla biomes like those from Terralith, William Wythers Expanded Ecosphere and Cliff Under a Tree is here! (If there is a specific data pack or mod you're interested in, please let me know on [Planet Minecraft](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/village-hero-1-20-1/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/not-blue/village-hero-plus/discussions).)
  - The gifts are limited to items available in vanilla
