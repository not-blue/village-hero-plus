# Village Hero+
This pack aims to make villagers show their appreciation a bit more when you defeat a raid by replacing the villager gift loot tables. Each profession has a roughly 0.5% chance of dropping a rare item, such as a goat horn, block of ancient debris, netherite smithing template, enchanted golden apple or even a luck potion--which you can use for a chance at more gifts!

A couple of notes: 

- If you're using Minecraft 1.21.1 or earlier, bundles must be enabled, as they are part of the leatherworker's loot table.
- The rare gifts from the butcher and leatherworker are luck potions, and the fletcher has a chance of giving arrows of luck. With this data pack, luck increases the chance of bonus rolls for additional gifts while a player has the Hero of the Village status.
- Nitwits will still give you seeds and pre-1.21.2, baby villagers will still give you poppies.
- _**List of gifts for 1.21.2-1.21.3 coming soon**_
